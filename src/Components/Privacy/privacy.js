  </div>
  
  
  <p>
      <strong>Failure to provide personal data</strong>
      <strong></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      If I need to collect your personal data under the terms of a contract I
      have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, I may not
      be able to perform the contract I have or am trying to enter into with you.
      For example to provide you with goods and services. In this case I may have
      to cancel delivery of a product or service you may have requested from me -
      but I will notify you in this case.
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>How I use your data (The lawful basis for the processing)</strong>
      <strong></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Performance of contract</em>
      <u></u>
  </p>
  <p>
      In store / by email / by social media / by phone.
  </p>
  <p>
      This means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance
      of a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps at your request
      before entering into such a contract. For example, to communicate with you,
      to facilitate logistics and to provide payment to or to receive payment
      from you.
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Legitimate interest</em>
      <u></u>
  </p>
  <p>
      Via my website - To monitor and improve the quality of my website platform.
  </p>
  <p>
      This means the interest of my business in conducting and managing my
      business to enable me to give you the best possible service / product and
      the most secure experience. I make sure I consider and balance any
      potential impact on you and your rights before I process your personal data
      for my legitimate interest. I will not use your personal data for
      activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless
      we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to by law)
  </p>
  <p>
      I would also use your data when you have given me your consent. This means
      you have opted to receive emails by contacting me directly with an enquiry.
