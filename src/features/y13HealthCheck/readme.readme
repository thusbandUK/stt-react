things to do:

add @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object to dependencies at some point - still needs addressing
work through other error messages and warnings
reconnect the forms when the site is launched on Netlify
create pages for cookies and connect the React cookie banner
create blog contents pages
etc.
